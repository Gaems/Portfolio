                            My name is Elliot Brookes, I'm a self-taught programmer based in Herefordshire and Dorset. I am someone who is motivated when faced with complex
                             problems and thrive on being forced to learn in order to solve a problem.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have been programming as an interest
                            since I recieved a first Raspberry Pi in 2012. I am someone who is
                            looking to develop my skills and to create exciting solutions on a variety of platforms
                            using a multitude of technologies. I'm eager to learn from those in the 
                            industry to further develop my knowledge and skillset. Also, I am willing to explore all opportunities 
                            that allow for future career development.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Recently, I've been moving towards making more ambitious
                            and permanent projects, this portfolio is the perfect example. This was
                            developed using the Anime.js library and is a project that i intend to update
                            and develop moving forward as I progress as a developer. Any other projects that
                            I develop will have their repositories on my GitHub (link at the start).
